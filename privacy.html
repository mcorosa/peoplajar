      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <div class="main">
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>PeopleJar Inc. ("PeopleJar" or "us" or "we") is the first universal people search company in the world with a global initiative to connect people across the planet, and break down our borders and differences by using the Internet. In order to fully participate in this process, you will be afforded the opportunity, through our website located at peoplejar.com (the "PeopleJar Website"), to describe yourself, your interests and everything else that makes you exactly who you are so that people of like minds around the world can connect with you. As such, in the course of using our services you may provide us and/or others using our services with personal information about you. This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") describes our policies and practices with respect to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information on the PeopleJar Website. By accessing and using the PeopleJar Website you acknowledge and agree to all of the terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.</p>
        <h3>What Is Personal Information?</h3>
        <p>When this Privacy Policy uses the term "personal information" we mean information that identifies you, such as your full name (first name and surname together), postal address, and email address. When certain other information such as your PeopleJar group affiliations or other non-identifiable information is directly associated with the aforementioned personal information, this other information also becomes personal information for purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>For persons in European Union countries, as used herein, the term "personal information" also refers to "personal data" as defined by the Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data ("Directive"). We will not collect any personal data from you unless you provide it voluntarily by providing us with your freely given specific and informed consent. By using the PeopleJar Website, you agree that we may transfer your personal data outside the European Union in connection with the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy. Your personal data may be transferred to and stored within the United States.</p>
        <h3>Our Policy on Children Under the Age Of 13</h3>
        <p>Children under the age of 13 are not eligible to use the PeopleJar Website and/or any of the services provided thereon. We ask that minors (i.e. persons under the age of 18 or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) not submit any personal information to us or use the service without the express consent of their parent or guardian and then only after such parent or guardian has reviewed and agreed to our Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h3>Your Privacy Rights</h3>
        <p>We may from time to time provide you with the opportunity to receive information about product and service offered by us and/or our third party marketing partners. You can prevent future disclosures of your personally identifiable information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, at no charge, by exercising your "opt out" rights as follows: go to the "Settings" link on the PeopleJar Website and modify your privacy preferences by opting-out of direct marketing communications from PeopleJar and/or our third party marketing partners.</p>
        <p>Because we provide you with the ability to exercise your "opt out" rights as described above, we do not provide the names and addresses of third parties that received personal information from us for such third parties' direct marketing purposes.</p>
        <h3>Our General Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>Please read this Privacy Policy to learn more about:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What personal information of yours is collected by PeopleJar</li>
          <li>How your personal information is used</li>
          <li>How your personal information may be shared</li>
          <li>How you can access, change and/or delete your account information</li>
          <li>What security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of personal information collected by PeopleJar</li>
          <li>How to contact us</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What Personal Information of Yours is Collected by PeopleJar</h3>
        <h4>Aggregate Data and IP Addresses</h4>
        <p>If you only search the PeopleJar Website and are not a registered user, the only information we collect about you will be information determined through the use of non-invasive technologies generally used by websites (e.g., technologies which determine which Internet browser you are using and/or your IP address) and anonymous data (such as search queries).</p>
        <p>Like most websites, PeopleJar uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a small data file which resides on your hard drive which allows PeopleJar to recognize your computer when you return to the PeopleJar Website. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies, you may not be able to use the PeopleJar Website.</p>
        <p>Generally the information and data we collect in the manner described above is used in order to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience.</p>
        <h4>User Submissions</h4>
        <p>PeopleJar also collects personal information from you which you voluntarily provide us when registering on our PeopleJar Website, becoming a member of PeopleJar networks, or communicating with us electronically. The types of information we may collect and maintain through your user submissions may include your name, email address, date of birth and location. In addition, you may be asked to provide optional information such as gender.</p>
        <p>We may also collect message board communications and complaints you may have about our services or other users. This type of information is collected, used and disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and its use is limited to the objectives for which it was collected as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h4>User Profiles</h4>
        <p>Once you complete your registration with us, you may provide additional information about yourself as part of your individual user profile, depending on the PeopleJar networks you wish to join. For example, if you join a musicians network, you may be asked to provide information on your instrument, years of experience, and musical genre of interest. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is encouraged but is entirely optional. Providing such additional information will better enable other users to connect with you. Your general profile will be accessible to all other registered users of the PeopleJar Website. Please note that while you may choose to opt-out of having certain information you have provided us from being listed in your general profile (such as particular PeopleJar network memberships or other attributes), such information will be still be accessible to those searching specifically for such information. For example, if you have listed that you are a guitar player looking to be in a 1970's glam rock band in San Diego but did not necessarily want everyone at the office to know about your alternative music interests, you could hide this information so that it would not show up in your general profile. Users interested in searching for glam rock band guitar players could still connect with you by running a query for glam rock band enthusiasts in San Diego. However, anyone (i.e. your boss) trying to research you by way of your name would only access your general profile wherein your interests in playing music in costume and heavy make-up would not be revealed. We believe the foregoing arrangement best balances your privacy needs while still maintaining the open connectivity necessary for the PeopleJar Website to serve its function.</p>
        <h4>Sweepstakes and Contests</h4>
        <p>To participate in some of our sweepstakes, contests, surveys, and other promotions, you may be asked to provide personal information such as your name and mailing address. This information may be collected by us or by third parties such as co-sponsors or vendors for the promotion. The names of third parties such as co-sponsors (other than vendors hired by us to conduct, administer, and execute a promotion on our behalf) will be disclosed to you when you are asked to sign up for the promotion. You should review such third parties' privacy policies to see how they may use any information that they collect.</p>
        <h4>Resumes for Jobs at PeopleJar</h4>
        <p>When we have any job openings here at PeopleJar from time to time, we may allow for the online submission of resumes. Please be advised that information (including personal information) contained in a job applicant's resume or otherwise submitted to us in a business capacity is not subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. The information obtained from your resume will be used for the purpose of accepting and evaluating your submission for a job with us and contacting you, your previous employers and your references in connection with that purpose.</p>
        <h3>How Your Personal Information is Used by PeopleJar</h3>
        <p>PeopleJar will communicate with you and other registered users through email, PeopleJar message boards, or notices posted on the PeopleJar Website. We will send you an email after you register with an activation link. We may also use the information we collect from you for the purpose of providing you with technical support, customer service, and account maintenance. We use the information we collect to learn what you like, tailor your experience accordingly, and to improve the PeopleJar Website. We send e-mail or messages to our registered users who want to receive e-mail or messages from us, but, [as discussed above] you may "opt-out" of receiving marketing and/or promotional emails or messages at the time you register as a user on the PeopleJar Website or at any time by accessing the "Settings" link and changing your preferences.</p>
        <p>We may also provide any personal information which you have put in your general profile to other users who utilize PeopleJar's search query capability (for example, a user may ask for a list of other users who have searched for certain attribute).</p>
        <p>Non-personal or aggregated information that cannot be associated with or traced back to a specific person may be used to personalize and enhance your PeopleJar Website experience by displaying content and marketing messages we believe will be of interest to you and to deliver content that is specific to your country or area of residence. When users browse the PeopleJar Website, for example, we gather information about the number of users who are viewing each page so that we can learn what features are the most popular. In addition, we may gather demographic information for analytical purposes on an anonymous, aggregate basis.</p>
        <p>We keep your information for a period reasonably necessary to meet the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any legal requirements, including statutory retention periods. When your personal information is no longer required for a specific purpose or legal requirement, it will be erased from our records.</p>
        <h3>How Your Personal Information May be Shared</h3>
        <h4>General</h4>
        <p>Although PeopleJar connects people via the Internet, PeopleJar takes the privacy of our users seriously. We do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personal information to any third parties for marketing purposes. However, since personal information which you provide in your general profile will be publicly available, we cannot guarantee that other users will not collect and/or use your personal information for purposes other than for which you intended.</p>
        <h4>Service Providers</h4>
        <p>Other than making your general profile and network affiliation information available to other users of the PeopleJar Website, we may share your personal information with third parties to provide specific services. These third parties do not retain, share, or store any personal information except to provide these services and are bound by strict confidentiality agreements which limit their use of such information.</p>
        <h4>Law Enforcement</h4>
        <p>We may also disclose any of your Personal Information to law enforcement or other appropriate third parties in connection with criminal investigations, investigation of fraud, infringement of intellectual property rights, or other suspected illegal activities, or as otherwise may be required by applicable law, or, as we deem necessary in our sole discretion, in order to protect the legitimate legal and business interests of PeopleJar.</p>
        <h4>Changes in Control</h4>
        <p>If PeopleJar assigns all of its rights and obligations regarding the use of your personal information at the time of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, sale of all or substantially all of the PeopleJar Website assets to a subsequent owner or operator, or similar event, you hereby agree and consent to have the disclosure to, and use by, a subsequent owner or operator of the PeopleJar Website, of any personal information contained in the PeopleJar database.</p>
        <h4>Data Aggregators</h4>
        <p>We may disclose anonymous, aggregated information about our PeopleJar Website users to third parties. We may provide aggregated data about the usage of our services or demographic information to third parties for such purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate, including third party ad servers. We may segment our users by interest area (i.e. sky-diving, knitting), industry, geographic location and any other category or attribute.</p>
        <p>Accessing, changing and/or deleting your account information</p>
        <p>As a registered user, you may access and change your account information by going to the "Settings" link on the PeopleJar Website. In addition, if you deactivate your account your general profile will become inaccessible by other users during the period of such deactivation.</p>
        <p>If you would like to have your personal information removed from our active databases, we will do so within a reasonable time after your request and we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal data is not used (except as may be required by law) by us after your notification to us. In order to make such request you may go to the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; link on the PeopleJar Website and click on the &ldquo;Delete&rdquo; link. An email will be sent to your email address with a request to click on the included link to confirm deletion of your account; after you click on this link, your account will be terminated and your personal information will be removed from the PeopleJar Website.</p>
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>We have put physical and managerial procedures into place in order to help safeguard and prevent unauthorized access, use and/or disclosure of your personal information. Although we use reasonable efforts to safeguard the security of your personal information, transmissions made on or through the Internet and personal information stored on our servers or the servers of third parties that we use are vulnerable to attack and cannot be guaranteed to be secure.</p>
        <p>While PeopleJar takes reasonable precautions against possible breaches in the PeopleJar Website and customer databases, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure. Consequently, PeopleJar cannot and does not guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. PeopleJar urges you to take steps to keep your personal information safe by memorizing your password or keeping it in a safe place, logging out of your user account, and closing your web browser.</p>
        <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time by notifying registered users via e-mail of the existence of a new Privacy Policy and/or posting the new Privacy Policy on the PeopleJar Website. All changes to the Privacy Policy will be effective when posted, and your continued use of the PeopleJar Website or service after the posting will constitute your acceptance of, and agreement to be bound by, those changes.</p>
        <h3>Questions or Comments</h3>
        <p>If you have questions or comments about this privacy policy, please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@peoplejar.com">privacy@peoplejar.com</a> or contact us at:</p>
