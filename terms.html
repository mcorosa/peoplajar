        <h3>Policy on Repeat Infringers</h3>
        <p>Termination of Repeat Infringers. In compliance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the &ldquo;DMCA&rdquo;), it is PeopleJar&rsquo;s policy to terminate the accounts of users whom PeopleJar deems to be repeat infringers.</p>
        <p>Response to Notice. If you believe that your copyrighted work is being infringed, PeopleJar will respond to a notice received by its DMCA agent specified below (&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;) if it contains substantially the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A physical or electronic signature of a person (the &ldquo;Complaining Party&rdquo;) authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that is allegedly infringed;</li>
          <li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single Notice, a representative list of such works at that site;</li>
          <li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit PeopleJar to locate the material;</li>
          <li>The Complaining Party&rsquo;s name, address, telephone number and email address;</li>
          <li>A statement that the Complaining Party has a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</li>
          <li>A statement that the information in the Notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the Complaining Party is authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the event that PeopleJar&rsquo;s DMCA agent receives such a Notice, PeopleJar will, in accordance with the DMCA, expeditiously remove or disable access to the material that is alleged to be infringing. In addition, to avoid any liability to the user for mistakenly removing or disabling access to the user&rsquo;s material, PeopleJar will also: (i) forward the Notice to the user; and (ii) take reasonable steps to promptly notify the user that it has removed or disabled access to the material.</p>
        <p>The DMCA permits users to contest the removal or disabling of access to their material by sending a written notice (&ldquo;Counter Notification&rdquo;) to the DMCA agent. To be valid, a Counter Notification must include substantially the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The user&rsquo;s physical or electronic signature;</li>
          <li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;</li>
          <li>A statement under penalty of perjury that the user has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;</li>
          <li>The user&rsquo;s name, address, and telephone number; and</li>
          <li>A statement that the user consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which user&rsquo;s address is located, or if the user&rsquo;s address is outside the United States, for any judicial district in which PeopleJar may be found, and that the user will accept service of process from the Complaining Party or an agent of such person.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Upon receipt by its DMCA agent of a valid Counter Notification, PeopleJar will, in accordance with the DMCA:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Promptly provide the Complaining Party with a copy of the Counter Notification;</li>
          <li>Inform the Complaining Party that it will replace the removed material or cease disabling access to it in ten (10) business days; and</li>
          <li>Replace the removed material and cease disabling access to it within ten (10) to fourteen (14) business days following receipt of the Counter Notification, provided that PeopleJar&rsquo;s DMCA agent has not received notice from the Complaining Party that an action has been filed seeking a court order to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on PeopleJar&rsquo;s site.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Governing Law</h3>
        <p>The Agreement between you and PeopleJar will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to conflict of laws principles.</p>
        <h3>Resolution of Disputes</h3>
        <p>In order to expedite and control the cost of disputes, you and PeopleJar agree that any legal or equitable claim relating to this Agreement (referred to as &ldquo;Claim&rdquo;) will be resolved as follows:</p>
        <h4>(a) Informal Resolution</h4>
        <p>You and PeopleJar agree that we will first try to resolve any Claim informally. Accordingly, neither of us may start a formal proceeding (except for Claims involving any violation of the federal trademark or copyright laws, or for injunctive relief) for at least 30 days after one of us notifies the other of a Claim in writing. PeopleJar will send its notice to your billing address, with a copy via email to your email address. You will send your notice to:</p>
        <p>
        <strong>PeopleJar, Inc.<br />
        185 N. Crescent Dr<br />
        Beverly Hills, CA 90210 USA<br />
        USA</strong>
        </p>
        <h4>(b) Formal Resolution</h4>
        <p>Agreement to Arbitrate. Except as provided in below, if we cannot resolve a Claim informally, we agree that any and all Claims either of us asserts shall be resolved solely through binding arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted under the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service (&ldquo;JAMS&rdquo;) that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, including the rules for the exchange of non-privileged and relevant information, and under the rules set forth in this Agreement. If there is a conflict between JAMS rules and the rules set forth in this Agreement, the rules set forth in this Agreement will govern. If you initiate the arbitration, you agree to pay a fee of $125 or, if less and you tell PeopleJar in writing, the amount that you would pay to initiate a lawsuit against PeopleJar in the appropriate court of law in your state. Other fees will be paid in accordance with JAMS rules. The arbitration will be held at a location in your hometown area (meaning, the closest JAMS dispute resolution center to your hometown) unless you and PeopleJar both agree to another location. In the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Forms and other information on filing such a Claim can be found at www.jamsadr.com. BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE AS SET FORTH HEREIN, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE BOTH WAIVING OUR RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.</p>
        <p>Special Rules. You and PeopleJar agree that the type of arbitration in which we both agree to participate is between PeopleJar and you as an individual. YOU AND PEOPLEJAR ARE AGREEING THAT NEITHER OF US WILL UTILIZE OR ATTEMPT TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION ARBITRATION PROCEDURES IN ANY ARBITRATION.</p>
        <p>Exceptions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) any Claim involving a violation of applicable trademark or copyright laws, or a Claim for injunctive relief, may be decided only by a federal court (or, for injunctive relief, federal or state court) in the County of Los Angeles, state of California, and (ii) neither you nor PeopleJar shall be precluded from filing a Claim in small claims court for disputes within the small claims court jurisdictional level.</p>
        <h4>(c) Severability</h4>
        <p>You and PeopleJar agree that if the agreement to arbitrate as set forth above is found to be unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, it shall be severed from this Agreement and, in that event, you and PeopleJar agree to submit to personal jurisdiction in California and agree that any Claim shall be exclusively brought in the appropriate state or federal court in the County of Los Angeles, state of California. You and PeopleJar also agree that if the agreement not to utilize class action arbitration procedures is found to be unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, regardless of the enforceability of the general arbitration procedure above, any class action Claim shall be exclusively brought in the appropriate state or federal court in the County of Los Angeles, state of California and you agree to submit to personal jurisdiction in California.</p>
